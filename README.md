[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/playground) is so ðŸ”¥ right now.

[ChatGPT](https://www.codegpt.co/) is very good but I wanted a tiny garage project to learn/experiment with [go](https://go.dev/) + test [wails](https://wails.io/) with an actual project + learn more about [prompting](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/prompts-and-completions).

Development: `wails dev`  
Building: `wails build -clean -upx -webview2 embed`
