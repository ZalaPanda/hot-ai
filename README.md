# hot-ai

[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/playground) is so ðŸ”¥ right now.

[ChatGPT](https://www.codegpt.co/) is very good but I wanted a tiny garage project to learn/experiment with [go](https://go.dev/) + test [wails](https://wails.io/) with an actual project + learn more about [prompting](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/prompts-and-completions).

Development: `wails dev`  
Building: `wails build -clean -upx -webview2 embed`

> Icons used during development: [bearicons Outline Color](https://icons8.com/icons/authors/DFlb6Xyr8saR/bearicons/external-bearicons-outline-color-bearicons)

## ideas

- [ ] Save chats in [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB) and add search bar
- [ ] Save modified presets + create new ones + upload avatar too
- [x] Redesign button layout
- [x] [Frameless](https://wails.io/docs/v2.4.0/guides/frameless) appearance
- [ ] Generate icons with [DALL-E](https://labs.openai.com/)
- [ ] Check [releases](https://api.github.com/repos/ZalaPanda/hot-ai/releases) to check last version
- [ ] Create tooltip component
